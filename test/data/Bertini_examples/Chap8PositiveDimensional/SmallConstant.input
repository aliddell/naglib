% SmallConstant.input
%
% When the constant is bigger than FinalTol, this
% looks like one irreducible component.  But when
% it is small enough, it is judged to factor into
% two lines.
%
% If the constant really is supposed to be nonzero,
% the problem should be re-scaled to make this
% apparent.
%
% The default FinalTol is 1e-11.  Play with
% changing FinalTol and the constant to see what
% happens.
