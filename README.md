# NAGlib

NAGlib is a Python library for numerical algebraic geometry.
Mostly, it's just a wrapper around [Bertini](https://bertini.nd.edu) (sold separately).
(Note: I am not a member of Bertini team, just an interested user who likes automating things.)

## Installing NAGlib

Don't install NAGlib.
It's not ready yet.
If you want something right now and you're into Julia, you might try [Bertini.jl](https://github.com/PBrdng/Bertini.jl).

If you absolutely must, ensure you have Python 3, NumPy, and [mpmath](https://mpmath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), then run

```shell
$ python setup.py develop
```

in this directory.
