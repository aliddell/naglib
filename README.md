# NAGlib

NAGlib is a Python library for numerical algebraic geometry.
Mostly, it's just a wrapper around [Bertini](https://bertini.nd.edu) (sold separately).

## Installing NAGlib

Don't install NAGlib.
It's not ready yet.
If you want something right now and you're into Julia, you might try [Bertini.jl](https://github.com/PBrdng/Bertini.jl).
